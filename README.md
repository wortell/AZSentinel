## Why this PowerShell Module

At the moment there is no documented API, ARM or PowerShell module to configure Azure Sentinel. After doing some research we were able to find the API's that are currently being used by the Azure Portal and based on that we've written a PowerShell module to manage Azure Sentinel through PowerShell.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities
